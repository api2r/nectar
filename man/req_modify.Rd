\usage{
req_modify(
  req,
  ...,
  path = NULL,
  query = NULL,
  body = NULL,
  mime_type = NULL,
  method = NULL,
  call = rlang::caller_env()

}
\arguments{
\item{req}{(\code{httr2_request}) A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{path}{(\code{character} or \code{list}) The route to an API endpoint. Optionally,
a list or character vector with the path as one or more unnamed arguments
(which will be concatenated with "/") plus named arguments to
\code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the path.}

\item{query}{(\code{character} or \code{list}) An optional list or character vector of
parameters to pass in the query portion of the request. Can also include a
\code{.multi} argument to pass to \code{\link[httr2:req_url]{httr2::req_url_query()}} to control how
elements containing multiple values are handled.}

\item{body}{(multiple types) An object to use as the body of the request. If
any component of the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or
otherwise give it the class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{mime_type}{(\verb{length-1 character}) The mime type of any files present in
the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to guess.}

\item{method}{(\verb{length-1 character}, optional) If the method is something
other than \code{GET} or \code{POST}, supply it. Case is ignored.}

\item{call}{(\code{environment}) The environment from which a function was called,
e.g. \code{\link[rlang:stack]{rlang::caller_env()}} (the default). The environment will be mentioned
in error messages as the source of the error. This argument is particularly
useful for functions that are intended to be called as utilities inside
other functions.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.
}
\description{
Modify the basic request for an API by adding a path and any other
path-specific properties.

req_base <- req_init("https://example.com")
req_modify(req_base, path = c("specific/{path}", path = "endpoint"))
