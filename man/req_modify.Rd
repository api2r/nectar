\usage{
req_modify(
  req,
  ...,
  path = NULL,
  query = NULL,
  body = NULL,
  mime_type = NULL,
  method = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{path}{The route to an API endpoint. Optionally, a list with the path
plus variables to \code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the path.}

\item{query}{An optional list of parameters to pass in the query portion of
the request.}

\item{body}{An object to use as the body of the request. If any component of
the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or otherwise give it the
class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{mime_type}{A character scalar indicating the mime type of any files
present in the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to
guess.}

\item{method}{If the method is something other than GET or POST, supply it.
Case is ignored.}
