\arguments{
\item{req}{(\code{httr2_request}) A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{path}{(\code{character} or \code{list}) The route to an API endpoint. Optionally,
a list or character vector with the path as one or more unnamed arguments
(which will be concatenated with "/") plus named arguments to
\code{\link[glue:glue]{glue::glue()}} into the path.}

\item{call}{(\code{environment}) The environment from which a function was called,
e.g. \code{\link[rlang:stack]{rlang::caller_env()}} (the default). The environment will be mentioned
in error messages as the source of the error. This argument is particularly

other functions.}
