\usage{
.req_body_auto(req, body, mime_type = NULL, call = rlang::caller_env())
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{(\code{httr2_request}) A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{body}{(multiple types) An object to use as the body of the request. If
any component of the body is a path, pass it through \code{\link[fs:path]{fs::path()}} or
otherwise give it the class "fs_path" to indicate that it is a path.}

\item{mime_type}{(\verb{length-1 character}) The mime type of any files present in
the body. Some APIs allow you to leave this as NULL for them to guess.}

\item{call}{(\code{environment}) The environment from which a function was called,
e.g. \code{\link[rlang:stack]{rlang::caller_env()}} (the default). The environment will be mentioned
in error messages as the source of the error. This argument is particularly
useful for functions that are intended to be called as utilities inside
other functions.}
}
\value{
A modified HTTP \link[httr2]{request}.
}
\description{
Automatically choose between \code{\link[httr2:req_body]{httr2::req_body_json()}} and
\code{\link[httr2:req_body]{httr2::req_body_multipart()}} based on the content of the body. This is
currently experimental and needs to be tested on more APIs.
