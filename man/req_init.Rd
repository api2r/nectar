all calls to the API. In some cases there may be a family of base URLs,
from which you will need to choose one.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{additional_user_agent}{(\verb{length-1 character}) A string to identify
where a request is coming from. We automatically include information about
your package and nectar, but use this to provide additional details.

}
\value{
A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.
}
\description{
For a given API, the \code{base_url} and user agent will generally be the same for
every call to that API. Use this function to prepare that piece of the
request once for easy reuse.
}

  "https://example.com",
