\usage{
.req_policy(req, ..., call = rlang::caller_env())
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{(\code{httr2_request}) A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.}

\item{...}{}

\item{call}{(\code{environment}) The environment from which a function was called,
e.g. \code{\link[rlang:stack]{rlang::caller_env()}} (the default). The environment will be mentioned
in error messages as the source of the error. This argument is particularly
useful for functions that are intended to be called as utilities inside
other functions.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[httr2:request]{httr2::request()}} object.
}
\description{
This function is based on the unexported \code{req_policies()} function from
httr2. It is used to apply policies to a request object. I don't currently
export this function, but that may change in the future.
